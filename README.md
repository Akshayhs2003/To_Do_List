This code defines a simple To-Do List application using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a brief description:

1. GUI Initialization:
   - The Tkinter window is created with a specified title, dimensions (650x410), and background color (`#f5f5f5`).

2. Labels:
   - Three labels are added for the title, "Add Task" section, and "Tasks" section.
   - Labels are styled with various fonts, sizes, and colors.

3. Listbox and Text Widgets:
   - A Listbox (`self.main_text`) displays the list of tasks.
   - A Text widget (`self.text`) allows users to input new tasks.
   - Both widgets are styled with specific fonts, sizes, and background colors.

4. Buttons:
   - "Add Task," "Delete Task," "Clear All Tasks," and "Switch Theme" buttons are added.
   - Buttons are styled with different background colors, fonts, and sizes.
   - Callback functions (`add_task`, `delete_task`, `clear_all_tasks`, `switch_theme`) are defined for button actions.

5. Functionality:
   - `add_task`: Adds the content from the Text widget to the Listbox and appends the task to a file named 'savedtasks.txt'.
   - `delete_task`: Deletes the selected task from the Listbox and updates the 'savedtasks.txt' file.
   - `clear_all_tasks`: Clears all tasks from the Listbox and updates the 'savedtasks.txt' file.
   - `switch_theme`: Toggles between light and dark themes, updating the color scheme of GUI elements.

6. File Handling:
   - Tasks are saved and loaded from a file named 'savedtasks.txt'.
   - The file is opened in append mode when adding tasks and in write mode when deleting tasks.

7. Theme Switching:
   - The `switch_theme` function changes the color scheme of the application, providing a visual switch between light and dark themes.

8. Main Application Loop:
   - The Tkinter main loop (`root.mainloop()`) is used to run the application continuously.

Overall, this code creates a functional To-Do List application with a simple and visually appealing interface.
